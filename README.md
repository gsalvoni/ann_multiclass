# Speech Recognition - Deep Learning Multi-Class Classification
A deep learning model for speech recognition.

## Goal
Read a dataset containing audio samples, pre-process the data, and create a machine learning model to recognize spoken digits. 

## Technologies
Project created with:
* Python
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras

## Method
Deep learning algorithm with four layers. MLP Classifier and Keras were used, the later led to better performance.
